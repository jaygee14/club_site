# club_site

## This repository is based off the *Challenge Project: Reponsive Club Website* in the improved styling with css section of the *Front End* Devleloper career path.

### Goal

The goal is to make a reponsive website. The challenges required were using responsive sizing, one javascript command, one media query command. My site is a fictional non profit club called "Music Lovers". Music lovers has free members and paid members.
